In recent years, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology has significantly transformed the dairy industry. AI algorithms are deployed to optimize various facets of dairy farming, including herd management, milk quality assessment, and predictive analytics for efficient production. Simultaneously, blockchain technology ensures transparent and secure data management across the dairy supply chain, from farm to consumer. This convergence not only enhances operational efficiency but also strengthens trust by providing immutable records of product origin and quality, thereby reshaping the dairy industry towards greater sustainability and consumer confidence.
